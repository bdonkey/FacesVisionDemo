# Notes
## 2017-11-28
* repo in [bdonkey][3]
* using `appleMLFaceVD` conda environment, `python 2.7.13`
* see [here][1] for partial setup
* in `xcode` project must add converted `ml` files to `compile sources` `build phase`. See [here][2]
* ended up just downloading the `emotions` model from [here][4] following repo directions
* overall not impressed with results of model on faces
